## Prepare
1. Creating a virtual environment
```bash
conda create --name MDPS python=3.10
```

2. Install packages
```bash
conda activate MDPS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download datasets
We evaluate MDPS on the datasets MVTec and BTAD.
You should download the dataset to the path ./datasets

4. You can use our checkpoints, download it to the path ./checkpoints:

## Train
To train a Unet, you can simply run the train.sh. (Modify the category in the ./config/train.yaml)
```bash
sh train.sh
```

## Test
To test our checkpoints, you can simply run the eval.sh
```bash
sh eval.sh
```
